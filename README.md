# An introduction
This is an app we built for the hackathon condcuted by ACM, VIT. 
Our problem statements were: Fetch images from online, implement data pushing and fetching using Firebase RealtimeDatabase, and implment MVVM/BLoC/Redux architecure.
To combine all of these into one app, we've built Signet, an app that can manage web bookmarks for you. You can share any web link with Signet, and it'll keep track of them for you. Whenever you want to refer back to them, you can open the app and click the respective card.

# How to use it
First, install the app on your phone. Open the app and sign in with your Google account.
After the initial setup procedure, in any web browser or news app, you can tap the share button, an then select Signet from the apps list.
The app will then show you the link's card and you can confirm saving it.
If you want to check your bookmarks, just open the app and click the respective card.

# Challenges we faced
Making Google sign in and RealtTimeDatabase use MVVM architecure was something we'd never done before. Finding tutorials and documentation on it was quite a task too. In the end, we used our own logic and shifted it to use MVVM without any external help. 

# Completion status
The app is 100% complete.
